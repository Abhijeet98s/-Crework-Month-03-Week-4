### Task

You have to create a task management board containing two lists: **To-do and Done**

1. Each list will contain some list items by default. (This can be static and hard coded, no need to create a new list item on the fly)
2. When you click on a list item from “To-do” list, it should get transferred to “Done” list, and vice-versa.
3. There will also be an “Swap All” button that will transfer all the list items of to-do list to done.
4. Once you click on a list item, it should be moved and a popup message should appear in the bottom right saying, "List Item moved successfully" and it should contain an UNDO button which will reverse the action. This is applicable for Swap All button too.
5. The popup should be visible for 2 seconds. (Add any UI element to showcase the remaining time out of 2 seconds on the popup)

Use all the react fundamentals that you have learnt so far - State Management, List Rendering, Conditional Rendering, UseEffect Hook, SetTimeout Function, etc.
